        <p>
            We are aiming to start a positive news and media company for people who are  mentally affected due to COVID-19. Just imagine how does a COVID-19 affected people would look at the world if he is seeing news tv channels 24x7 with his family everyday. There are riots, pandemic, encounters, suicides and media is filled with negative content so a question arises do our COVID-19 affected population really need to see all this? We don't need to bombard them with all the negative news and Indian population also don't have an option these channels, newspapers and twitter are the only source for their updates and news.<br>
            <br>
            So we want to solve this problem, in simple words: We want to build a positive platform for COVID affected population So that they can understand that their is still a lot of hope left.<br>
